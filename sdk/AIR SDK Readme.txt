======iOS Target Support======

If you have downloaded a version of the AIR SDK that supports packaging iOS targets, additional files will be included. The following files and folders in the AIR SDK contain the tools that enable you to compile AIR applications into .ipa files for iOS devices.

LIB
 - AOT - Directory containing the files necessary for the AOT (Ahead of Time) Compiler used by ADT


======Getting Started with the AIR SDK======

1) Build your source files using the editor of your choice. Arrange them as you would on a web server, in a single folder with relative references.

2) If you are using the AIR APIs in JavaScript, include a <script> reference to the AIRAliases.js file. AIR APIs are only available to your application content (not to content loaded from remote sources). Also, there are limitations on calling the eval() function and similar APIs in AIR application content. For details, see the AIR SDK documentation (listed below).

3) Use ADL to test your application with the debugger.

4) Use ADT to build an application installer that can be distributed to other people.

5) If you're distributing your AIR application from a web page, refer to the topic "Distributing and installing using the seamless install feature" in "Developing Adobe AIR Applications with HTML and Ajax". 

More information about all of these steps is available in the "Developing Adobe AIR Applications with HTML and Ajax". See the next section for the locations of the AIR documentation.
